# Tic Tac Toe Webserver

## Goal

just playing around with docker, js and fastapi.

## What is this

I am trying to make a webserver that can host games like Tic tac toe inside of docker.

## Quick start

You need to change the `const API_BASE_URL` to your Ip so you can hoset games on your device. 
Go into `/docker` and run `docker compose up` to starte the docker containers.

After that go in our Webbrowser to `YourIp:8080` and start Planing with your friends.

## Sources and Tools i used

- Copilot for Css parts of the `script.js` and debugging
- [the Fast Api docs ](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- The Docs from my other Folders in my Hasp-Syt repo and docker files as refarence.
- Stackoverflow
